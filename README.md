# Module 6 Challenge



## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and data files for the San Francisco real estate market analysis project. The project aims to analyze the housing rental market in San Francisco using data visualization techniques and provide insights for potential investment opportunities.

## Files
- `san_francisco_housing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
- `sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv`: Dataset containing census data for San Francisco neighborhoods.
- `neighborhood_coordinates.csv`: Dataset containing coordinates of San Francisco neighborhoods.

## Data Analysis
The analysis consists of the following main tasks:

1. **Housing Units per Year**: Calculate and visualize the trend in housing units over the analyzed period.
2. **Average Sale Prices per Square Foot**: Analyze the average sale prices per square foot and their relationship with gross rent.
3. **Average Sale Prices by Neighborhood**: Compare average sale prices per square foot across different neighborhoods.
4. **Interactive Neighborhood Map**: Visualize neighborhood data on an interactive map.
5. **Data Story**: Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Usage
To run the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure the required dependencies are installed (`pandas`, `hvplot`, `geoviews`, etc.).
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
